    Builds a collection of user stats within each county.
    All tweets are partitioned by county.

    The created collection will consist of documents with the following
    information, which applies per user within the region.

        state_fips : The state fips of the county
        county_fips : The county fips
        geoid : The state-county fips code
        user_id : The user id
        numHashtags : Total number of hashtags that were tweeted
        numHashtagsUnique : Number of distinct hashtags that were tweeted
        hashtags : List of unordered, tweeted hashtags, with repeats
        numTweets : Total number of tweets
        numTweetsWithHashtags: Total number of tweets with hashtags

    The following correspond to to each other, but they are not
    chronologically ordered. The should simply be extended by
    other counts from user tweets in other regions. Using the statuses
    count may allow one to order the elements.

        followers_count : The number of followers at each tweet
        friends_count : The number of friends at each tweet
        favourites_count: The number of favourited statuses at each tweet
        statuses_count: The number of statuses at each tweet
        create_at: The creation date and time of each tweet

    Note that the statuses_count can be used to get a better sense of how many
    tweets we have missed from the users. This total number combined with the
    ratio of numTweetsWithHashtags/numTweets can be used to estimate the number
    of tweets with hashtags that we missed, with some assumptions about a fixed
    ratio of geotagged tweets from the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tweet_collection :
        The collection containing the tweets to partition.
    county_collection :
        This is where the user stats will be stored.
        It will be emptied if dry_run is False.
    shpfile :
        This is the shapefile that contains county information.
        In particular, it must contain the geometry of the county.
    skip_users :
        The set of user ids to skip.
        For the current db, this is an iterable of ints.
        For the future, it should be an iterable of strings,
        and then we will query id_str, instead of id.
    dry_run : bool
        If True, then we only extract and build the stats, but nothing
        is saved to the collection.

    Returns
    -------
    skips : dict
        The total number of skipped tweets in each region by name.
        This is mostly informational. The name is not a useful key.
