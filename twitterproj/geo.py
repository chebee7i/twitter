def polygon_hashtags(collection, polygon, skip_users=None):
    """
    Returns hashtag counts for all tweets in a polygon.

    Parameters
    ----------
    collection : MongoDB collection
        The collection of tweets.
    polygon : Shapely Polygon, geoJSON Polygon, list
        The coordinates of the polygon. Note that for a list, the [polygon]_
        should be a list of LinearRing coordinate arrays. A LinearRing
        coordinate array is a list of (longitude, latitude) pairs that is
        closed---the first and last point must be the same.
    skip_users : list of int
        A list of Twitter user ids. Any tweet from these user ids will be
        skipped and not included in the counts.

    Returns
    -------
    counts : defaultdict
        The counts for each hashtag. Keys are hashtags, values are counts.
    skipped : int
        The number of tweets that were not counted, due to `skip_users`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> seattle = [
    ...     [[-122.4596959,47.4810022],
    ...      [-122.4596959,47.7341388],
    ...      [-122.2244329,47.7341388],
    ...      [-122.2244329,47.4810022],
    ...      [-122.4596959,47.4810022]],
    ... ]
    ...
    >>> counts, skipped = polygon_hashtags(collection, seattle)

    Notes
    -----
    This relies on MongoDB's geospatial queries.
    A '2dsphere' index on the collection will speed this up.
