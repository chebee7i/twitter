=======

This repository contains scripts relating to a Twitter tweet analysis project. Most of the functionality is not intended to be a general purpose, user-facing API, so it will be more speicifc rather than more general---scripts will assume a particular schema for databases, etc. That said, many of the ideas/implementations are probably of more general interest for me in other projects, and possibly, for others as well.
